# TeamvoyTestTask
Create a rest controller for creating orders in storage (any storage can be used).
The orderEntity has three fields: price, quantity, itemEntity (please chose any three).
The orderEntity is valid for 10 minutes (not valid orders can be deleted).
Create another rest controller which will return the requested itemEntity at the lowest price (the number of itemEntities must be reduced in storage). If there are not enough itemEntities, return all available.

Requirements:

- Please write code using Java 11 and Spring Boot, also create tests to cover the main logic.
- You can upload the source code on any public repository

Expected Result:
- Bugs free source code with the full-implemented requirements
